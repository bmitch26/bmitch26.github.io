            <h2>Transformers (BERT) and VADER for Sentiment Analysis of DFW Sports Teams</h2>
            <p>February was a massively important month for three of the professional sports teams in the DFW area â€“ the Cowboys, Mavericks, and Rangers. As a result, I was curious to examine recent fan sentiment. Therefore, I scraped the newest comments for these teams' subreddits, processed the text, and analyzed them using a rule-based approach in VADER and a deeper contextual approach using transformers (BERT). This project aims to compare accuracy levels in fan sentiment classification, visualizing the results for both VADER and BERT models, and comparing tradeoffs.</p>
            <h2>Random Forest Model Training for Retail Sales Forecasting</h2>
            <p>Understanding customer shopping patterns is crucial for optimizing inventory management and enhancing the overall shopping experience. However, there is often a lack of insights into the key factors influencing sales. In this experiment, a data-driven approach is used to uncover patterns, forecast sales, and identify factors that contribute significantly to the variation in sales across different customer segments from a dataset of retail shopping malls in Istanbul. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop an accurate sales forecasting model by leveraging machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on a variety of factors.</p>
            <h2>ARIMA Forecast Model & Web Application to Predict Auction House Prices & Display Historical Auction Data</h2>
            <p>Data analytics plays an important role in auction houses. This presentation discusses our application of data analytics tools in the WoW virtual auction house. This includes consistent auction house item data gathering, historical database creation for item data, converting and characterizing the item data into different formats, and predictive model application visualized on the frontend. Through these processes, we aim to provide WoW players with novel insights that aid in maximizing user in-game profit and overall auction house decision-making.</p>
            <h2>Image Classification with CNN and SVM</h2>
            <p>The following is an ongoing project with data collected from Kaggle, with additional fine-tuning to be added for completion. The task to be solved at hand is as follows: I am a worker for a social media platform, and my task is to create a solution using deep learning to discern whether a post is holiday-related in an effort to better monetize the platform. I must classify the following six categories: Miscellaneous, Christmas_Tree, Jacket, Candle, Airplane, Snowman. I need required to classify the images in the dataset based on these categories. To solve, I will approach this task by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Support Vector Machines(SVM). Using these two in tandem can be an effective method for feature extraction(CNN) for resulting classifications (SVM).</p>
            <h2>GPA and Study Hours Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Linear Regression</h2>
            <p>The following dataset includes 193 students at a university, their grade point averages(GPA), and hours studied per week. An exploratory data analysis(EDA) and linear regression model is created to see to see if there is a relationship between these two variables. At the end of experimentation, it is determined that there is a slight positive correlation between hours studied and GPA.</p>
